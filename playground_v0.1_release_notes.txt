Alright everyone, I got the playground set up and it is in the Github. 
If someone wants to to export it and make it into a WAR please feel free. 
I added task to do for the front and back end on the Github project page (you can find the link in the front or backend chats). 
I will also be posting the release notes right under this, please feel free to ask me any questions and remember to communicate what you are working on so we can all be on the same page

********************

Playground v0.1

********************

— Some Quick notes —

- Code is working, homepage is functional. Login button and create account are not redirected properly but that will be something I will have the backend work on.
- If you want to access the login page just put /login after “/app”
- The dispatcher should be all set, we may need to add more maven dependency as time goes on once we are more familiar with the tech we will be using.

********************

Front End:
- Create a more fleshed out home page
- Link the loginStyle CSS file to the login page ( or make a new one)
