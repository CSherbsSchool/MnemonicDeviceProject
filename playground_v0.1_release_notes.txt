Playground v0.1
********************

— Some Quick notes —

- Code is working, homepage is functional. Login button and create account are not redirected properly but that will be something I will have the backend work on.
- If you want to access the login page just put /login after “/app”
- The dispatcher should be all set, we may need to add more maven dependency as time goes on once we are more familiar with the tech we will be using.
