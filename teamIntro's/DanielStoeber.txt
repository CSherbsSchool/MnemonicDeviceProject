My name is Daniel Stoeber, I'm currently taking classes here at WCC and also at EMU for the first time.
Will definitely be my busiest school semester yet but hopefully that won't stop us from making a great project.
In my free time I like to play video games, mostly Rocket League, and I also like camping with my family
when it's not freezing outside. Nice to meet you all.
