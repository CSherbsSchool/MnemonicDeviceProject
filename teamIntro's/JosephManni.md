Hello everyone,

I'm Joseph (or Joe), and I'm currently in my last semester here at WCC. While C++ is definetely my strongest language, I am pretty good at Java, Python, SQL, HTML, and CSS. I'm currently working on learning node, bootstrap, and php, and it looks like spring is going to be added to that list for this project! I'm a very fast learner, and enjoy learning new skills. I also have a good amount of experience in Linux/Unix systems. I look forward to working with everyone on this project, and am happy to fill any position needed.
