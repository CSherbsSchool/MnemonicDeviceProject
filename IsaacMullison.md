#Introduction

Hello,

My name is Isaac Mullison. My top two languages are probably Java and Kotlin (having done a fair amount of Android projects outside of class), but I am also pretty good at JS. Some additional experience that I have, which is likely to be relevant, includes HTML, CSS, and JSP/Spring (having taken CPS 278 last semester). I also have a small amount of experience using Flutter (which allows one to write both a Web and an Android app using the same code).

I enjoy doing front-end design, but if anyone needs me for a different position, please let me know.

Looking forward to working with all of you!
